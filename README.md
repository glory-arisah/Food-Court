## Coding Approach

For this take-home assessment, I built a food recipe application using **React** with the following approach:

### 1. Project Setup
- Installed and configured core dependencies:
  - **TailwindCSS** for styling and utility-first design.
  - **Axios** for handling HTTP requests.
  - **React Router DOM** for client-side routing.
- Set up a reusable `axiosClient` using `axios.create()` for consistent API requests.

### 2. API Utilities
- Created a dedicated utilities file to manage API calls.
- Encapsulated all endpoint logic based on the specifications from the interview instructions page.

### 3. Home Page (Recipes Listing)
- Implemented the **recipes grid** with meal cards.
- Added **category filtering** to display meals by category.
- Integrated **local search filtering** to quickly search through already fetched meals.
- Included **sorting functionality**.

### 4. Meal Details Page
- Built a dedicated view to display detailed information about a selected meal when a recipe card is clicked.

### 5. Error Handling & Feedback
- Installed and configured **React Toastify** to provide user-friendly error notifications, especially for failed fetch requests.

### 6. Deployment
- Deployed the project to **Netlify** for easy access and review.

### 7. Refactoring & Cleanup
- Cleaned up redundant code and refactored React pages for readability, scalability, and maintainability.
